# Millefeuille Documentation

Millefeuille is a budget management app that I'm building for mostly my own personal use. The original Millefeuille was essentially a random bunch of SQL script hastily put together that mostly didn't work very well. This new one should work better because it will be a **Properly Made Software Application**.

## The technical bits aka random technical buzzwords.

Typescript, React, PostgreSQL, node.js, etc.
