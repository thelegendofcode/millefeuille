# What is Millefeuille?

Millefeuille is a combination of multiple micro-apps that come together to build a picture of your financial status.

The list of micro-apps consists of

- a portfolio visualiser
- an asset allocation recommender
- an expenses tracker
- a budget planner
- bank accounts scrapper
- business cashflow visualiser
- payments reminder
- and more

Each micro-app should be considered a separate, stand alone app that can run on its own.
