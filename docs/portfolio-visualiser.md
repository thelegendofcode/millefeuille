# Portfolio Visualiser

What is my main purpose of having this?

- A quick glance should let me know what my current holdings are
- how much they're worth
- how much gains/loss
- ratio between principal and current value
- break down between index funds and individual stocks
- current value at current exchange rates
- projected future value
- balance of remaining budget
- missed payments
