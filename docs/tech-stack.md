# Millefeuille Tech Stack - the cody bits

![Buzzwords! Buzzwords everywhere!](images/buzzwords.jpg)

## Millefeuille is a web app built mostly with React, some parts Vue and some parts Angular (maybe even Mythril!) that is Continually Integrated on CircleCI running Puppeteer e2e tests. Above a certain Code Coverage percentage, a Docker image will be created to be mounted via Kubernetes and Continually Deployed on clusters of AWS EC2s.

Probably.

It is an SPA. It will run on the browser. Most of that will be running React. Parts of it may run Vue, Angular, Mythril and all that.

All of that will be written in Typescript.

The back end will probably be parts Nodejs and parts Go.

The data will be mostly stored in PostgresSQL (RDS) though some bits will be in NoSQL (DynamoDB).

Most of the hosting will be on AWS, though I'd like to put some stuff on GCP and others more on Azure. I'm not sure what yet. Oh hell, let's throw in Heroku too.

You think I'm joking but I intend to use this as my technical playground. You were warned.

Anyway.
