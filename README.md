## Mission
I want everyone to live a financially fulfilling life.

I'm building this to improve myself financially and work towards financial independence. In order to realise that goal, it's important that I understand where I am financially so that I may set accurate targets and goals to achieve.

Something about FIRE. Spend less than you earn, put savings into low cost index funds, avoid unnecessary expenses.
