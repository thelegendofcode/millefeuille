## Mission
I want everyone to live a financially fulfilling life.

### Vision
I'm building this to improve myself financially and work towards financial independence. In order to realise that goal, it's important that I understand where I am financially so that I may set accurate targets and goals to achieve.

### Philosophy
Something about FIRE. Spend less than you earn, put savings into low cost index funds, avoid unnecessary expenses.

## Development

This app essentially serves as my personal dev playground so it will consist of a whole bunch of different technologies. Some that may not necessarily right for the job, just something I feel like messing about with.

Standardisation of technologies will be considered should Millefeuille actually become popular enough with real users.

## Monetisation
For the time being, this is being launched as a free app.
