## Introduction

Millefeuille is a budget management web app that I'm building for myself but you can use it if you want to (when it exists). Originally, this was essentially just a bunch of SQL scripts and random javascript snippets hastily put together that broke every time.

This new one will work better because we'll do it **Properly This Time™**.
